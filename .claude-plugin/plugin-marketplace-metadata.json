  "longDescription": "SUI Dev Agents provides a comprehensive toolkit for building production-ready SUI blockchain applications. Includes 22 user-invocable skills, 19 orchestration agents, 9 commands, 8 auto hooks, 5 rule files, and a built-in MCP server with 14 gRPC tools. Covers the complete development lifecycle: architecture planning, Move smart contract development, adversarial security testing (Red Team), on-chain contract analysis (Decompile), frontend integration, comprehensive testing with coverage analysis, agent wallet operations, multi-network deployment, and ecosystem integrations (Kiosk, zkLogin, DeepBook, Walrus, SuiNS, etc.). All gRPC-native — no JSON-RPC dependency.",
